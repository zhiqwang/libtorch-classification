Installation
============

To install yolort, you may either use the repository

   https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/

and `setup.py` from there or use

::

   pip install yolort


to get the latest release and

::

   pip install 'git+https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack.git'

to install the development version.

Note that `yolort` is still under rapid development, we expect to break API
compatibility in the versions before 1.0 when we find that usability
benefits from slightly reorganizing things.
