# üî¶ Yolov5 Runtime Stack

[![Stable](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/workflows/Stable/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/actions?query=workflow%3AStable) [![Nightly](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/workflows/Nightly/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly)

Yet another implementation of Ultralytics's [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), and with modules refactoring to make it available in deployment backends such as `libtorch`, `onnxruntime` and so on.

- Refactor YOLO modules and support *dynmaic batching* inference, *Nov. 16, 2020*.
- Support exporting to `onnx`, and inferring with `onnxruntime` interface. *Nov. 17, 2020*.
- Add graph visualization tools. *Nov. 21, 2020*.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

There are something different comparing to [ultralytics's](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/yolo.py) implementation. This repo can load ultralytics's trained model checkpoint with minor modifications, I have converted ultralytics's lastest released [v3.1](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v3.1/yolov5s.pt) checkpoint [here](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/releases/download/v0.2.1/yolov5s.pt).

You can also convert ultralytics's trained (or your own) model checkpoint with the following command:

```bash
python -m utils.updated_checkpoint [--checkpoint_path_ultralytics ./checkpoint/yolov5s_ultralytics.pt]
                                   [--checkpoint_path_rt_stack ./checkpoints/yolov5s_rt_stack.pt]
```

### üî• Loading via `torch.hub`

The models are also available via torch hub, to load `yolov5s` with pretrained weights simply do:

```python
model = torch.hub.load('zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True)
```

### ‚ú® Inference on `PyTorch` backend

There are no extra compiled components in `yolov5-rt-stack` and package dependencies are minimal, so the code is very simple to use. We provide instructions how to install dependencies via conda. First, clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack.git
```

Then, install PyTorch 1.7.0+ and torchvision 0.8.1+:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```

To read a source image and detect its objects run:

```bash
python -m detect [--input_source YOUR_IMAGE_SOURCE_DIR]
                 [--labelmap ./notebooks/assets/coco.names]
                 [--output_dir ./data-bin/output]
                 [--min_size 640]
                 [--max_size 640]
                 [--save_img]
                 [--gpu]  # GPU switch, Set False as default
```

You can also check the [inference-pytorch-export-libtorch](notebooks/inference-pytorch-export-libtorch.ipynb) notebook for more details.

### üöÄ Inference on `LibTorch` backend

Here provide an [example](./deployment) of getting `LibTorch` inference to work. Also you can check the [CI](.github/workflows/stable.yml) for more details.

## üé® Model Graph Visualization

Now, `yolov5-rt-stack` can draw the model graph directly, check for more details in [visualize-jit-models](notebooks/visualize-jit-models.ipynb) notebook.
